= Pilha

A object oriented wrapper for the StackExchange/StackOverflow API

== Why such a strange name?

'Pilha' (pronounced peeleeah) means 'stack' in portuguese.

== Instalation

  gem install pilha

== Example

Pilha aims to provide a ActiveRecord like interface for querying the StackExchange API.

  include StackExchange::StackOverflow
  StackExchange::StackOverflow::Client.config do |options|
    options.api_key = 'your_key' #optional
  end

  Badge.all # returns all badges
  User.find_by_badge_id(2) # returns all users awarded by the badge identified with 'id'

As all response objects returned by Pilha are instances of OpenStruct, so you need to call
the 'api_methods' on a desired class to see which methods of the OpenStruct were added
by the gem.

  Question.api_methods

  # => [:@struct, :question_id, :tags, :creation_date, :last_activity_date, :up_vote_count,
      :down_vote_count, :view_count, :score, :community_owned, :title, :body, :answers,
      :answer_count, :accepted_answer_id, :favorite_count, :question_timeline_url,
      :question_comments_url, :question_answers_url, :owner]
